# Docker

## Basic commands

- docker **`pull`** <image>	: Fetches the given image from the Docker registry
- docker **`images`**		: Lists all images fetched to our system
- docker **`run`** <image>	: Runs a Docker container based on the provided image
- docker **`ps`**			: (**p**rocess **s**tatus) Shows all the containers that we have currently running 
- docker **`ps -a`**		: Shows all the containers that we have ran but are currently inactive
- docker <command> `--help`	: Displays help (basically available options) about provided command

## Running a container

BusyBox is a tiny Linux distro that packages many common Unix utilities (`ls`, `sh`, `cat`, ...) into a single binary, resulting in a very small image (usually less than 1 Mb.)

First we are going to pull busybox image from Docker hub:

   `docker *pull* busybox`

Next we run a busybox container followed by a command:

   `docker run busybox ls -la`

The Docker client[^1] finds the image, creates a command and runs the `ls -la` command in that container:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Apr  9 16:22 .
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Apr  9 16:22 ..
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root             0 Apr  9 16:22 .dockerenv
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         12288 Sep 26  2024 bin
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root           340 Apr  9 16:22 dev
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Apr  9 16:22 etc
drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody        4096 Sep 26  2024 home
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Sep 26  2024 lib
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             3 Sep 26  2024 lib64 -> lib
dr-xr-xr-x  441 nobody   nobody           0 Apr  9 16:22 proc
drwx------    2 root     root          4096 Sep 26  2024 root
dr-xr-xr-x   13 nobody   nobody           0 Apr  9 16:22 sys
drwxrwxrwt    2 root     root          4096 Sep 26  2024 tmp
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root          4096 Sep 26  2024 usr
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root          4096 Sep 26  2024 var
```

The command is executed within the container, and the process stops. If we want to start an interactive session, the **`-it`** option allows to interact with the container via a shell:

   `docker run -it busybox sh`

- `-i` option (i stands for interactive) tells Docker to keep STDIN open on the container, allowing it to receive input like typed commands or piped data
- `-t` option (stands for teletype/terminal) allocates a pseudo-tty which gives you a terminal interface on your machine
	
> The `sh` command to start shell is not really necessary in this case, and an interactive shell will start even if we run the container without any command because `sh` is the default command defined in the BusyBox image. The image has something like `CMD[sh]` in its Dockerfile so whe you don't specify a command Docker falls back to that default, which happens to be the shell.
> Specifiying the command wuld matter using an image where the default command is not a shell, for instance
>   `docker run -it python sh`

To finish shell session, use the **`exit`** command.


## Container isolation. Restarting/executing containers.

**`docker ps -a`** displays a list of all the containers, even the stopped ones:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
116268d6f047   alpine    "ash"     10 minutes ago   Exited (0) 9 minutes ago              reverent_volhard
a8ee7dd5130a   alpine    "sh"      12 minutes ago   Exited (0) 11 minutes ago             awesome_gauss
309a1b13c3bb   busybox   "sh"      13 minutes ago   Exited (0) 12 minutes ago             practical_elion
```

In the example we see that even though each `docker container run` command used the same alpine image, each execution was a separate, isolated container. Each container has a separate filesystem and runs in a different namespace; by default a container has no way of interacting with other containers, even those from the same image. Any change done within a container (e.g. creating a new file) will not affect the rest. This is a critical security concept in the world of Docker containers.

To restart a container session, we can use docker command **`start`**. However, running

   ~~`docker start 116`~~

makes the container run in the underground quietly with no terminal attached, so we cannot interact with it. To do so, before starting the container we need to **`attach`** to it:

   `docker start 116268`

   `docker attach 1162`

Or, alternatively, we can combine both commands in one go using `-a` (attach) and `-i` (interactively) options:

   `docker start -ai 116268d6f`

We can send a command in to the container to run by using the **`exec`** command:

   `docker exec <container_ID> ls -la`

This command can also be used as a third way to start an interactive session with a stopped container:

   `docker start 116268d6f047`

   `docker exec -it 116268d6f047 sh`


## Deleting containers

Leaving all those stray containers eat up disk space. To clean up once we have done with them, use the **`rm`** command:

   `docker rm <container ID>`

To delete a bunch of containers in one go:

   `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)`

In later versions, `docker container prune` command does the same.


## Creating our own images

We can pull an existing image, run it in a container and modify it as needed. E.g.:

```bash
docker container run -it ubuntu bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y figlet
figlet "Hello!"
```

Our container installs the 'figlet' package and runs it, displaying 'Hello' in an ASCII-art way. If we want to share our new application, we must **`commit`** our changes:

   ```docker container commit <container_ID>```

We can also **`tag`** it so that it is easier to identify when we display a list of our system `images`:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`docker image tag <container_ID> <my_image_name>`

In case we want to list the files that were added or changed to the original container, we can use the **`diff`** command:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`docker container diff <container_ID>`

Now we can run a container based on our newly created _<my_image_name>_ image:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`docker container run my_image_name figlet hello!`

## Creating our images using a Dockerfile

What we have just created is a static binary image, that is, a file system with the modified files, executables and configs. These are "raw binary files" in the sense that itâ€™s just the built, saved state of the container at that moment.
- This image can be run but you don't know how it was built
- You can't easily reproduce, modify or update its content unless you <ins>reverse-engineer</ins> it
