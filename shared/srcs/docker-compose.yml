# [1] `:ro`
#
#     Read-only mode. We are telling Docker to mount this volume in the 
#     container but disallow writing to it. It is a good practice because
#     - Nginx is just serving static files, so it does not need to write
#     - This prevents accidental or malicious changes to WordPres content
#       from the Nginx container. 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [2] ports: "443:443"
#
#     This maps a container port to our host machine, making it externally
#     accessible. NGINX is our public-facing entry point, thus it must be 
#     reachable from outside the Docker network.
#     We don't need to EXPOSE ports for MariaDB and WordPress because these
#     services are only accessed internally within the Docker network (that
#     we called 'inception'). Docker Compose automatically exposes all 
#     container ports to other containers on the same network, without ports:.
#     Adding `EXPOSE <port_number>` to Wordpress or MariaDB Dockerfiles can be
#     done but is purely declarative (a hint or documentation) but it does not
#     expose a port to the host or affect container behaviour. Real exposure
#     only happens when you define `ports:` in `docker-compose.yml` file.
#     
#     Services listen on their standard/default ports:
#       - MariaDB listens by default on port 3306
#       - PHP-FPM (used by WordPress) listens by default on port 9000 (if
#         configured that way)
#
#     Docker Compose networking handles DNS resolution:
#       - Each service is accessible from others by its service name 
#       - You don't need to know the IP, Docker does the internal DNS routing
#
#     So how do they "know" where to connect?
#       - NGINX ↔ WordPress:
#           In `nginx.conf`, we specify:
#               `fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;`
#           That tells NGINX:
#             “Send PHP requests to a service named wordpress, port 9000.”
#           Since wordpress is the Docker Compose service name, and the container 
#           is listening on 9000, this works smoothly.
#
#       -  WordPress ↔ MariaDB:
#           In the `.env` file, we define a variable:
#             `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb:3306`
#           In the WordPress setup script we inject the value from `.env` into the
#           real config (copied from a default template):
#               `sed -i "s/localhost/${WORDPRESS_DB_HOST}/" /var/www/html/wp-config.php`
#           Again, Docker resolves mariadb to the correct container, and MariaDB
#           listens on 3306 by default.
