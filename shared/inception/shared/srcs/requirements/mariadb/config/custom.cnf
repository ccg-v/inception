# bind-address = 0.0.0.0
# 
# It tells MariaDB to listen on all available network interfaces, i.e., accept
# connections from anywhere, including Docker's internal bridge network, and 
# not just localhost.
# WordPress container connects to MariaDB via the container network (e.g., to 
# the hostname mariadb). If we donâ€™t set `bind-address = 0.0.0.0`, MariaDB
# might default to 127.0.0.1, which allows only local connections (inside the
# container itself), and our WordPress container would get:
#		ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server
# So `bind-address = 0.0.0.0` is essential for inter-container communication in 
# Docker, unless MariaDB is already set to bind externally by default.
